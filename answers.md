## TCP Ports
Answer to Questions: Port 80 is the port that the server listens to or expects to receive from a Web client. The service that runs through port 80 is used to send and receive unecrypted web pages. Port 443 is a virtual port that computers use to divert network traffic, and is globally used for HTTPS service.
Port 53: Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is an essential process for the modern Internet; it matches human-readable domain names to machine-readable IP addresses, enabling users to load websites and applications without memorizing a long list of IP addresses.
Port 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP allows computer clocks to sync with each other, a process that is essential for encryption.
Port 500: Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), which is part of the process of setting up secure IPsec connections.
